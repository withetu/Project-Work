library(caTools)
attach(iris)

#Set the seed to 100
set.seed(100)

#use the function sample.split with a SplitRatio=0.7 to split the dataset into two folds using the species class. store the results in the variable split
split = sample.split(iris$Species, SplitRatio = 0.7)

#use subset function to subset the dataframe where the split is True. Store this result in the variable called Train
Train = subset(iris, split == TRUE)

#Store the other 30 percent of the sample in the variable Test. Use the same subset method.
Test = subset(iris, split == FALSE)

#Print out the number of rows in the Test and Train variables. You should see 70 percent of data in the Train and 30 percent in the Test.
nrow(Train)
nrow(Test)

#Install and load the library “caret”
library(caret)

#Set the seed to 500 and use the createDataPartition to do the same 2 fold split as Q3 but with a 80:20 ratio with List=FALSE
createDataPartition(p = 0.8, list = FALSE, iris$Species)

#Use the createDataPartition function to create 5 different samples of the training data.
createDataPartition(p = 0.8, list = FALSE, time = 5, iris$Species)

#We know how to make 2 splits now and make 5 different samples. But what about 5 equal splits? Use the createFolds() command to make 5 equal partitions of iris data-set. Make sure that each partitiion has an equal representation of the species class as much as possible.
createFolds(iris$Species, k=5)
